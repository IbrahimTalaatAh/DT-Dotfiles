# xmonad: A Tiling Window Manager

![Screenshot of my desktop](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/raw/master/.screenshots/dotfiles05.png) 

Xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximising
screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard:
a mouse is optional. xmonad is written, configured and extensible in
Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings and other extensions
may be written by the user in config files. Layouts are applied
dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each
workspace. Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled
on several physical screens.

This directory houses my personal xmonad configuration (xmonad.hs).  To check out my config, you will need to have xmonad, xmonad-contrib and xmobar installed.   Then you need to place the xmonad.hs file in ~/.xmonad or in ~/.config/xmonad/.  Then recompile xmonad and restart xmonad.
