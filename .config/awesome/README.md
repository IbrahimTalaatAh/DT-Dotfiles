# My Awesome Configuration

![Screenshot of my desktop](https://www.gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/raw/master/.screenshots/dotfiles09.png)

Awesome is a highly configurable, next generation framework window manager for X.

# Features

* Simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts,
  widgets and commands.
* Configured in Python.
* Command shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be managed and
  inspected.
* Complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
  manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
* Qtile's remote scriptability makes it one of the most thoroughly
  unit-tested window managers around.

# My Keybindings

The MODKEY is set to the Super key (aka the Windows key).  I try to keep the
keybindings consistent with all of my window managers.

| Keybinding | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `MODKEY + RETURN` | opens terminal (alacritty is the terminal but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + RETURN` | opens run launcher (dmenu is the run launcher but can be easily changed) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + c` | closes window with focus |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + r` | restarts awesome |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + q` | quits awesome |
| `MODKEY + 1-9` | switch focus to workspace (1-9) |
| `MODKEY + SHIFT + 1-9` | send focused window to workspace (1-9) |
| `MODKEY + j` | switches focus between windows in the stack, going down |
| `MODKEY + k` | switches focus between windows in the stack, going up |
